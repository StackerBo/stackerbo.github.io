  <p> 
  Hello, and welcome to my personal website. My name is Bo Hu, and I am currently an undergraduate student at <span style="color: #007acc;">Tsinghua University</span>, 
  majoring in Mathematics and Physics & Materials Science and Engineering. My academic interests lie at the intersection of 
  <span style="color: #007acc;">artifical intelligence and materials science</span>, and I am particularly enthusiastic about 
  leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to advance scientific discovery. 
  </p> 
  <p> In 2025, I will begin my Ph.D. studies at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), where I look forward to further exploring the frontiers of AI-driven materials science research.
  </p> 
  <p> 
   Outside of academics, I greatly enjoy engaging in conversations and exchanging ideas with others. My hobbies include <span style="color: #007acc;">Sport Stacking, swimming, and traditional Chinese
    calligraphy.</span> If you're interested in my research or share similar interests, feel free to reach out to me via email—I'd be happy to connect. 
  </p>
